#You need to design a data structure that supports the following operations:

#get(key: int) -> int: Retrieve the value of the key if it exists in the cache. Otherwise, return -1.
#put(key: int, value: int) -> None: Insert or update the value of the key. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, evict the least frequently used key.
